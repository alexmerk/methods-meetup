Mu Sigma is a group of people that are highly interested in theory and application of statistical science. It was organized by several students and alumni of Humboldt University in the summer of 2019. We now have members of different age and backgrounds, including leading data scientist from several Berlin companies. The main goal of Mu Sigma is to gain better understanding of statistics by bringing motivated people together, sharing our experience, and working through papers or other sources of information.

The discussions in our meetings have a rather broad scope but mainly revolve around following topics:
* Epistemology: What is knowledge and how it should be obtained?
* The proper application of statistical methods in research and working environment
* Ongoing replicability crisis (especially in social sciences)
* Technicalities of particular statistical methods and/or software

## FAQ
Every two weeks we host a meetup where we go through a paper, talk about the latest events, and have free discussions. Every participant can propose a paper, which are then chosen by the majority vote.
