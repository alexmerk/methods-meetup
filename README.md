Mu Sigma is a group of people that are highly interested in theory and application of statistical science. It was organized by several students and alumni of Humboldt University in the spring of 2019. We now have members of different age and backgrounds, including leading data scientist from several Berlin companies. The main goal of Mu Sigma is to gain better understanding of statistics by bringing motivated people together, sharing our experience, and working through papers or other sources of information.

The discussions in our meetings have a rather broad scope but mainly revolve around following topics:
* Epistemology: What is knowledge and how it should be obtained?
* The proper application of statistical methods in research and working environment
* Ongoing replicability crisis (especially in social sciences)
* Technicalities of particular statistical methods and/or software

If you have more questions and/or might like to join us, please read the frequently asked questions (FAQ) below. To contact us, feel free to speak up in [our public Telegram group](https://t.me/mu_sigma) or write us an Email on .


## FAQ

- [**Can I see the list of papers you were reading?**](#is-there-a-list-of-papers-you-are-reading)
- [**How can I attend your meetup**](#how-can-i-attend-your-meetup)
- [**What background should I have to participate?**](#what-background-should-i-have-to-participate)


#### Is there a list of papers you are reading?
The list of the papers we've already read is available in [our meetup archive](meetup_archive.md). The list of papers proposed to read in future is available [here](reading-list.md).

#### How can I attend your meetup?
Please contact us on Telegram or via Email and do a short introduction of yourself.

#### What background should I have to participate?
To be able to follow the discussion, attendees should have at least some knowledge of statistics, programming, and mathematics (college undergrad level should generally suffice). However, due to the broad scope of our backgrounds and the papers we choose, it is not expected from everyone to understand the technicalities of each and every paper completely.
